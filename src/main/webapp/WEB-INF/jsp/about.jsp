	17. Scheduling system of the beauty salon. You need to create a page where the schedule 
	of the salon masters is displayed, so that you can make an record. Only admin and master 
	should see the records of clients, others see only the occupied place. After the provision 
	of services, the client leaves a comment. The proposal for writing a review comes to an email. 
	The admin can read comments about masters.
